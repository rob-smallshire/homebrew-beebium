# Homebrew cask for the Beebium macOS GUI app.
#
# This is the canonical copy, kept in the monorepo for development, review and
# CI (brew audit/style run against it). It is mirrored into the tap
# (rob-smallshire/homebrew-beebium, Casks/beebium-gui.rb) at release time by
# packaging/homebrew/sync-gui-cask.sh, which pins the two per-architecture DMG
# urls and their sha256s to a published release.
#
# The DMGs are Developer ID signed, notarized and stapled, so Gatekeeper accepts
# them on first launch. Unlike the beebium-server FORMULA (a source build of the
# headless servers), this CASK installs the prebuilt .app -- which embeds its own
# servers, ROMs, presets and extensions -- so the two do not overlap.

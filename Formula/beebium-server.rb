# Homebrew formula for the headless Beebium emulator servers.
#
# This is the canonical copy, kept in the monorepo for development, review and
# CI. It is mirrored into the tap (rob-smallshire/homebrew-beebium) at release
# time by packaging/homebrew/sync-tap.sh.
#
# The servers are built from source against Homebrew's own gRPC/protobuf/abseil.
# Since the ExtensionRpc channel landed, extension plugins no longer embed gRPC
# (they link only libbeebium_extension_api + the shared libprotobuf), so there
# is no duplicate-runtime hazard and no need to static-link gRPC the way the
# Linux bundle does.
